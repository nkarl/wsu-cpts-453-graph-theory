- [ ] Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
- [ ] HyperNetworks (HN)


- **G**raph **H**yper-**N**etworks (GHN) predicts the performance of any unseen neural networks by operating their *computational graph representations*.

- GHN can be generalized and applied to *anytime-prediction*, and outperform existing manually designed models.
