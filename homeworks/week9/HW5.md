In the current era, *media beyond written sources* have been effective in communicating complex mathematical ideas to a broad audience. Shining examples of this include YouTube videos such as the 3Blue1Brown videos produced by Grant Sanderson. **Find and provide a short synopsis of two YouTube videos each effectively explaining a problem that involves graph theory**. A “short synopsis” includes ***the URL along with at least two paragraphs*** of explanation and/or narrative.

A Markov chain is a probability distribution wherein the next state is dependent on the previous state, not the entire history sequence of states.

Given a Markov chain (of a directed graph) mapped to an adjacency matrix (which is also called a transition matrix), there exists a state vector $\pi$ composed of the probability distributions of all nodes in the chain. The state vector $\pi$ is the convergence of all the state vectors $\pi_i$ where $i = 0, 1, ... N$.

$$
\pi\cdot A = \pi
