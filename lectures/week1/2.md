A graph is a set V of vertices and E of edges.  In order for an edge e in E to *join* two vertices, we need some formalism.

More formally, a *graph* is an order triple {V, E, \psy} where:
    V is the set of vertices
    E is the set of edges
    \psy is the mapping \psy: E -> V^{(2)}, *which encodes which vertices are the endpoints of which edges*.

Let $\psy: E -> V^{(2)} where V^{(2)} = {{u, w}: u, w \in V}$

Notice that this allows for {u, u} which is actually the set {u}.

This is a formal way of saying hat the vertices u and w are the *endpoints* of the edge e.

If \psy(e) = {u, w}, then we say that:

1. The vertices u and w are the *endpoints* of the edge e
2. The edge e *joins* u and w
3. The edge e is *incident* with each of u and w.

A shorthand for this is $e = uw$.

If there exists an edge e incident with both u and w, then we say u is adjacent to w.

If u is *adjacent* to itself, then there is a loop $\l$ such that 

\[ \psy(\l) = {u, u} \]

. The shortshand version would be $\l = uu$.

We define the *order* of a graph $G$ as the cardinality of the set V. This written $|V|$. The variable n is fairly universally reserved for this purpose, i.e. $n = |V|$.

We define the *size* of a graph $G$ as the cardinality of the set E. This written $|E|$. The variable n is fairly universally reserved for this purpose, i.e. $m = |E|$.

When the graph is a null graph we must be aware that several theorem statements are incompatible with it.

Suppose we have V = {0..n-1}. Notice that this is a vertex set for a graph of *order* n. The rule for this graph is that vertices i and j are joined by a single edge iff |j - i| = 1.  The graph you get by follow this rule is called P_n, a path graph of n vertices. 

Suppose we have V = {0..n-1}. Notice that this is a vertex set for a graph of *order* n. The rule for this graph is that vertices i and j are joined by a single edge iff |j - i| = 1 or |j - i| = n - 1.  The graph you get by follow this rule is called C_n, a cycle graph of n vertices. 

Aanother way to get this same graph is to use arithmetic modulo n (i.e., use the elements in Z_n).  Your edge rule is now j - i \in {-1, 1}.
