A graph is a set $V$ of vertices and $E$ of edges.  In order for an edge $e$ in $E$ to **join** two vertices, we need some formalism.

More formally, a **graph** is an order triple $\{V, E, \psi\}$ where:
	    $V$ is the set of vertices,
	    $E$ is the set of edges,
	    $\psi$ is the mapping $\psi: E \rightarrow V^{(2)}$, *which encodes which vertices are the endpoints of which edges*.

Let $\psi: E \rightarrow V^{(2)}$ where:
									$V^{(2)} = {{u, w}: u, w \in V}$

Notice that this allows for $\{u, u\}$ which is actually the set $\{u\}$. This is a formal way of saying that the vertices $u$ and $w$ are the *endpoints* of the edge $e$.

If $\psi(e) = \{u, w\}$, then we say that:
	- The vertices $u$ and $w$ are the **endpoints** of the edge $e$
	- The edge $e$ **joins** $u$ and $w$
	- The edge $e$ is **incident** with each of $u$ and $w$

A shorthand for this is $e = uw$.

If there exists an edge $e$ incident with both $u$ and $w$, then we say $u$ is **adjacent** to $w$. As a special case, If $u$ is adjacent to itself, then there is a loop $l$ such that $\psi(l) = \{u, u\}$. The shorthand version would be $l = uu$.

### Order $|V|$ and Size $|E|$
We define the **order** of a graph $G$ as the *cardinality of the set $V$*, written as $|V|$. The variable $n$ is universally reserved for this purpose, $n = |V|$. In a similar fashion, we define the **size** of a graph $G$ as the *cardinality of the set $E$*, written as $|E|$. The variable $m$ is universally reserved for this purpose, $m = |E|$.

*Note:* when the graph is a **null** graph we must be aware that several theorem statements are incompatible with it.

Suppose we have:
				$V = \{x: x \in [0, n-1]\}$

Notice that this is a vertex set for a graph of *order* $n$. The rule for this graph is that vertices $i$ and *j* are joined by a single edge *if and only if* $|j-i|=1$.  The graph you get by following this rule is called $P_n$ which is a path graph of $n$ vertices.

Now, suppose we have the same set of vertices of order $n$. However, this time the rule is that vertices $i$ and $j$ are joined by a single edge *if and only if* $|j-i|=1$ or $|j-i|=n-1$. The graph you get by follow this rule is called $C_n$ which is a cycle graph of $n$ vertices.

Another way to get this same graph is to use *arithmetic modulo $n$* (i.e., use the elements in $Z_n$).  Your edge rule is now $j - i \in \{-1,1\}$.
