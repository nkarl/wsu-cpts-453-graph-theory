The graph $Q_n$ whose vertex set is:
				$V = \{$n-tuples of 0's and 1's$\} = \{0,1\}^n$

where two vertices are joined by an edge **iff** they are different exactly one coordinate.

				$V = \{(001), (00-1), (010), (0-10), (100), (-100)\}$

where two vertices are joined by an edge **iff** they are different exactly two coordinates.

The complete graph $K_n$ has vertex set:
				$V = \{0..N-1\}$
where any two distinct vertices are joined b a unique edge.

More precisely, for vertices $i$ and $j$, $i \neq j$ **iff** there is an edge joining $i$ and $j$.

We'll see soon that **"the total degree"** is twice the number of edges. In $K_n$, each vertex has degree $n-1$ and so the total degree will be $n(n-1)$. Hence. the number of edges in half of this, or

				$m = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} = C(n, 2)$

Another approach, every edge can be specified by choosing 2 of the n vertices available.

The complete *"bipartite graph"* $K_{n,q}$ has vertex set:

				$V=\{(00), (10), (20), .. , (p-10) \cup \{ (01), (11) (21)..  (q-1, 1)\} \}$
Notice that this is a disjoint union of two sets, these sets are called the **parts** of $V$. We join two vertices **iff** they differ in the second coordinate.
