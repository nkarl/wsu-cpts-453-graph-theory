A **closed walk** is a walk whose staring and ending vertices are equal, i.e. a $u$ , $u$-walk. A trivial walk is a considered to be a closed walk.

A **trail** is a walk that does not repeat and edge. Being a trail does not guarantee being a path.

A **circuit** is a closed walk *that is also a trail*.

A **cycle** is a circuit with at least one edge where the only repeated vertex is the start and the end.
